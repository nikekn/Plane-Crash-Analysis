# Plane_Crash_analysis using Data Science
*__Abstract__*<br/>
A flight in a plane is a profoundly exciting experience. But there is also a risk in the flying. Though the fact that instances of the plane crash
are not particularly normal, they are very fatal. According to the Telegraph news, the odds of deaths
of a person per total number of passengers flown is 1 to 6 million. Although the year 2015 is considered as the safest
year in the aviation history, there are 16 fatal crashes leading to the death of 560 passengers flown. It is followed by 19
fatal crashes leading to the death of 325 passengers flown in the year 2016. Even though the aviation giants took many
precautions to control these fatalities incidents are still being reported.


*__Approach__*<br/>
I  identified the no. of fatalities per year,the cause of fatal airplane crashes and found the number of crashed aircrafts and number of deaths against each
category of these segments.Doing this would help the aviation giants to take necessary care and precautions which decreases the casualties of airplane
crashes and increases the survival rate of these incidents reported. An open dataset by open data from Kaggle
containing 5268 airplane crashes with fatalities of 105k is used for this project.

*__Conclusions__*</br>
This analysis was done with the passenger's safety in mind.Having analyzed the fatality count per year and its causes,a rough idea regarding the pattern of the plane crash would be given to the airplane authority helping them to avoid circumstances which would result in the same.And also take appropriate measures ,if occured.
